There were some recent changes with the new MySQL database server v8. 

Come back to this lecture after you watch the next video.

--- Connecting to MySQL Database Server v8 with JDBC Driver, MySQL Connector/J v5.1.x

Starting with MySQL Database Server v8, the MySQL database has changed the default authentication plugin for MySQL server from mysql_native_password to caching_sha2_password.

As a result, you need to make minor changes to the security  configuration for your user account. Also, there were some recent  critical bug fixes in the 8.x JDBC driver, MySQL Connector/J.

1. Download from this link:

MySQL JDBC Driver, Connector/J v8

https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-8.0.13.zip

2. Unzip the download file and make note of the JAR file:  mysql-connector-java-8.x.y.jar

3. Copy the .jar file to the WEB-INF/lib directory. (remove any previous versions)

4. Log into the MySQL Workbench using your root account.

5. Run the following SQL script

alter user 'webstudent'@'localhost' identified with mysql_native_password by 'webstudent'; 

6. Back in Eclipse, for the database connection, you need change the JDBC URL.

File: context.xml

Replace

        url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/web_student_tracker?useSSL=false"

With

        url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/web_student_tracker?useSSL=false&amp;serverTimezone=UTC"

Based on these changes, your app will be able to connect to MySQL 8.

7. Test your application in Eclipse.
